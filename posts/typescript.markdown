title: Typescript
---

There are a lot of attempts to replace Javascript by anothers languages [see here](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS).
One of the major reason of redefining a new language that compile to Javascript is to have typed language on client side.
Typescript, designed by Microsoft, is one of theses languages.
What is different with Typescript and make me write about it today ?
I think the designers of Typescript have really understand one important thing about the front web developpers:
    They love Javascript and they don't want it replace by another completly different language.
That why they didn't decided to create a new language but a superset of Javascript.
What does it mean ? It's means that Javascript is Typescript compliant and Typescript brings some new features (typing) to Javascript.

I think that typing all the Javascript world is just a dream.
Typescript offer a way with declaration files to type any extern libraries.
But, one you wrote you declaration file, you have to maintain it.
In order to type existant Javascript, Typescript offer us a way be writing declaration files.
